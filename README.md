# Bayesian Simulation for Multi-Agent Search  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Bayesian simulation framework** for multi-agent search over a rugged landscape. The agents represent firms that learn from past experiences and optimize strategies using **machine learning (ML)**, **reinforcement learning (RL)**, and **Bayesian optimization**. The project integrates **large language models (LLMs)** to enhance decision-making and improve predictions of firm performance.

## Features  
- **Multi-Agent System**: Simulates firms operating in a dynamic environment, making strategic decisions based on previous observations.  
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Guides the search process, optimizing agent strategies for better performance.  
- **Neural Networks**: Utilizes deep learning to model firm behavior, predicting expected performance in different scenarios.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Enhances learning by leveraging pre-trained transformers for context-aware decision-making.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Agents adapt over time using PPO-based policies from `stable-baselines3`.  
- **Cloud-Ready Deployment**: Designed for execution on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning**: `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`, `Hugging Face Transformers`
